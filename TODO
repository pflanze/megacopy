- currently the program terminates upon encountering any error;
  make it behave more usefully.

- currently only works on Linux >= 2.6.33 as it uses sendfile for
  copying small files; simply revert to using File::Copy's copy and
  drop the size argument to it if you're on another system.

- implement heuristic for sparse handling in Perl, then copy all sizes
  of files unless file is sparse.
